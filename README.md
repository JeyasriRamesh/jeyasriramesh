### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analytics engineer and I enjoy operating at the intersection of business and technology. My daily work revolves around build data models for business needs and maintaining data integrity using DBT, Python, SQL and BI tools. 
I have a keen interest in learning new data tools and experimenting them with side projects.
